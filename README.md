# springboot---weatherapi
A Spring Boot RESTful API for fetching, storing, and managing weather data. This application integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather information for any city. All searches are saved in a database (using JPA/Hibernate), allowing users to track weather history.
